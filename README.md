Here I am storing scripts and notebooks regarding various interesting topics.

adiabatic_theorem.ipynb:
a numerical check of the adiabatic theorem regarding time-evolution of ground states under slowly-changing Hamiltonians, with 2 x 2 matrices.

phi_field:
a numerical study of the partial differential equation $\partial^2_t \varphi = \partial^2_t \varphi - V'(\phi)$ for a classical field $\varphi$ subject to a mexican hat potential $V(\varphi) = \lambda(\varphi^2 - 1)^2$
